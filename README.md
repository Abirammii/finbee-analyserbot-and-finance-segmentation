# Financial-Behavior-Segmentation-and-Advisory-Bot  
## Project Title: Financial Behavior Segmentation and AI-Driven Investment Advisory System  
### PROJECT OVERVIEW  

- In this project scenario, I am envisioning the role of a data scientist employed by a bank, where I analyzed a Kaggle dataset containing detailed customer information and financial behavior patterns.  
- The dataset provides comprehensive insights into customer-level attributes such as ```Age```, ```Gender```, ```Education```, ```Marital Status```, ```Income Range```, ```Card Type```, ```Tenure```, ```Credit Limit```, ```Transaction Behavior```, and ```Utilization Rate```.  
- The main objective of this project was to identify distinct financial behavior segments among customers using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **clustering techniques**.  
- These insights enable the bank to develop **personalized marketing strategies**, optimize **customer retention**, and recommend **tailored financial products** for different customer groups.  
- As an extension of this analysis, I developed an **AI-powered financial advisory web app* called ```FinBee```.  
- ```FinBee``` acts as a Smart Finance Analyser Bot helping customers evaluate their financial habits based on factors like income, expenses, and savings, and providing instant personalized advice.  
- This integrated project demonstrates how **data science, machine learning**, and **interactive web development (React)** can work together to deliver **data-driven financial intelligence** for real-world banking use cases.
