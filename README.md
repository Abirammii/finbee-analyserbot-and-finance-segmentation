# Financial-Behavior-Segmentation-and-Advisory-Bot  
## Project Title: Financial Behavior Segmentation and AI-Driven Investment Advisory System  

### PROJECT OVERVIEW  

- In this project scenario, I am envisioning the role of a data scientist employed by a bank, where I analyzed a Kaggle dataset containing detailed customer information and financial behavior patterns.  
- The dataset provides comprehensive insights into customer-level attributes such as ```Age```, ```Gender```, ```Education```, ```Marital Status```, ```Income Range```, ```Card Type```, ```Tenure```, ```Credit Limit```, ```Transaction Behavior```, and ```Utilization Rate```.  
- The main objective of this project was to identify distinct financial behavior segments among customers using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **clustering techniques**.  
- These insights enable the bank to develop **personalized marketing strategies**, optimize **customer retention**, and recommend **tailored financial products** for different customer groups.  
- As an extension of this analysis, I developed an AI-powered financial advisory web app called ```FinBee```.  
- ```FinBee``` acts as a Smart Finance Analyser Bot helping customers evaluate their financial habits based on factors like income, expenses, and savings, and providing instant personalized advice.  
- This integrated project demonstrates how data science, machine learning, and interactive web development (React) can work together to deliver data-driven financial intelligence for real-world banking use cases.

### DATASET DESCRIPTION  

The dataset, sourced from **Kaggle**, provides insights into the financial behavior and engagement patterns of bank customers.  It captures detailed information about customer demographics, credit activity, and account usage over time.  The data enables the identification of distinct customer segments based on their financial habits, supporting better decision-making and personalized financial recommendations.
